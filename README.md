### Hi there 👋

I'm Martin from 🇪🇪 Estonia 🇪🇺. Every now and then I push code to Github, that scratches my own itches (remembering [Kerckhoff's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)!).

Most probably you're here because of the "open source javacard software development toolkit" that consists of
  - 🌐 [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro)
  - 🐜 [ant-javacard](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard)

🛜 NFC/NDEF and 🔑 [FIDO/WebAuthn](https://github.com/martinpaljak/FIDO2) are topics where you can expect developments in 2023/2024. 

There are also historical bits and pieces related to generic smart cards (PC/SC, CCID) and crypto with Java/JavaScript/PKCS#11, and Estonian eID and identity (OpenID etc) in general.

When it comes to [Estonian eID](https://www.id.ee), most of what I worked on has been continued by others: [@OpenSC](https://github.com/OpenSC) (open source PKCS#11 and native platform crypto drivers for smart cards), [@web-eid](https://github.com/web-eid) (modern WebExtensions based authentication and signing for desktop browsers) and [@open-eid](https://github.com/open-eid) (ages ago I pushed Estonia to publish (most of) it's eID client software as open source)

Feel free to 💬 [book a call](https://calendly.com/martinpaljak/hello) if you have any questions or ongoing projects in these domains or to 🙏 [sponsor my open source work](https://github.com/sponsors/martinpaljak)!
