### Hi there 👋

I'm Martin from 🇪🇪 Estonia and every now and then I push to Github code that scratches my own itches.

Most probably you're here because of the "open source javacard sdk" that consists of
  - 🌐 [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro)
  - 🐜 and [ant-javacard](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard)

NFC/NDEF and [FIDO/WebAuthn](https://github.com/martinpaljak/FIDO2) are topics where you can expect developments in 2023/2024

There are also historical bits and pieces related to generic smart cards (PC/SC, CCID) and crypto with Java/JavaScript/PKCS#11 and Estonian eID.

Feel free to drop me a line via e-mail if you have any questions!
