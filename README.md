### Hi there 👋

Martin from 🇪🇪 Estonia 🇪🇺 here. Every now and then I push code to GitHub, that scratches my own itches (remembering [Kerckhoff's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)!).

Most probably you're here because of the "open source javacard software development toolkit" that consists of
  - 🐜 [ant-javacard](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard)
  - 🩺 [JCardEngine](https://github.com/martinpaljak/JCardEngine)
  - 🌐 [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro)

Currently figuring out how to best combine GlobalPlatformPro and JCardEngine without creating cyclic dependencies ;)

🛜 [NFC/NDEF](https://github.com/martinpaljak/NFC4PC) and 🔑 [FIDO/WebAuthn](https://github.com/martinpaljak/YAFU) and 🧑‍💻 [SSH](https://github.com/martinpaljak/java-ssh-provider) are topics where you can expect developments in 2025. 

There are also historical bits and pieces related to generic smart cards (PC/SC, CCID) and crypto with Java/JavaScript/PKCS#11, and Estonian eID and identity (OpenID etc) in general.

When it comes to [Estonian eID](https://www.id.ee), most of what I worked on has been continued by others: [@OpenSC](https://github.com/OpenSC) (open source PKCS#11 and native platform crypto drivers for smart cards), [@web-eid](https://github.com/web-eid) (modern WebExtensions based authentication and signing for desktop browsers) and [@open-eid](https://github.com/open-eid) (ages ago I pushed Estonia to publish (most of) it's eID client software as open source)

If you [sponsor my open source work](https://github.com/sponsors/martinpaljak) I can continue do to more of the above!
